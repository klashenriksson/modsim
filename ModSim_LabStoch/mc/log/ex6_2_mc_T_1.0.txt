Generate a simple starting configuration
Gas with 200 particles at T = 1, rho = 0.25, L = 28.284,  b = 0.4
Potential energy = -0.166922
Equilibrate: 1000...done

Simulate 10 blocks x 1000 samples each: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
Configuration with 200 particles written to conf/0200_r0.250_T1.000
Potential E: -0.688746 +/- 0.00202108
Pressure   : 0.22533 +/- 0.00105686
Pressure for ideal gas: 0.25
